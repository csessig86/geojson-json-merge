      GeoJSON-JSON merge
    </title>
  </head
  <body>
  <p>This script merges GeoJSON and JSON files based on a common property. In this example, the GeoJSON file of Iowa counties (counties.geojson) has a property called "NAMELSAD10 that includes the county name. This matches with a property in the JSON file (census.json) called name that also includes the county name.</p>

  <p>To load, open index.html. Then copy what is in merge.js and paste into your console. What will show in the console is a merged GeoJSON file. Copy and paste that over the existing GeoJSON file.</p>

  <script src="counties.geojson"></script>
  <script src="census.json"></script>
