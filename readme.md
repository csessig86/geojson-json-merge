#GeoJSON-JSON merge

This script merges GeoJSON and JSON files based on a common property. In this example, the GeoJSON file of Iowa counties (counties.geojson) has a property called "NAMELSAD10 that includes the county name. This matches with a property in the JSON file (census.json) called name that also includes the county name.

To load, open index.html. Then copy what is in merge.js and paste into your console. What will show in the console is a merged GeoJSON file. Copy and paste that over the existing GeoJSON file.
